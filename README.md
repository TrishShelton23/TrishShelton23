## Who Am I?
My name is Trisheia from Buffalo, NY, and I am a Web Developer and Graphics Designer. Passionate about creating beautifully minimal website designs with user-friendly interfaces. 

I create Wireframes, Mockups, and Prototypes using <img src=""> Figma to map out my project designs. My favorite coding languages so far are HTML and CSS. I am currently learning JavaScript as well as frameworks React and jQuery. I am always enthusiastic about new opportunities and excelling in my career. Feel free to check out my most recent graphics work when I upload it here on <a href="https://dribbble.com/T_Moshaire">Dribble</a>.
