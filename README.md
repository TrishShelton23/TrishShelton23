## Hii

My name is Trisheia from Buffalo, NY, and I am a Web Developer and UI designer. Passionate about creating beautifully minimal interface designs with user-friendly experiences. I create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes using Figma to map out my project designs. My favorite coding languages so far are HTML and CSS. I am currently learning JavaScript as well as frameworks React and jQuery. I am always enthusiastic about new opportunities and excelling in my career. Feel free to check out my most recent UI work when I upload it here https://dribbble.com/T_Moshaire.
